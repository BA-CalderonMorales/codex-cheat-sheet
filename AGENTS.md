# Codex Cheat Sheet - Project Guidelines

## Project Purpose

This repository provides a quick reference guide for OpenAI Codex CLI, helping developers master Codex without memorizing every command.

## Core Principles

### 1. Learn from Proven Examples

Use examples and structures that have demonstrated real-world value to the community. For this project, we drew inspiration from:

- **[claude-code-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/Njengah/claude-code-cheat-sheet)** (800+ GitHub stars) - Demonstrated that developers value progressive, level-based learning approaches for AI coding tools
- The progressive difficulty structure (Level 1 → Level 5) helps users build confidence incrementally
- Command reference tables provide quick lookup without reading prose

### 2. Prioritize Official Documentation

Always verify information against official sources before adding it to this guide:

- **Primary Source**: [OpenAI Codex Repository](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- Cross-reference all commands, flags, and configuration options against official docs
- Never hallucinate features or commands - if it's not documented officially, don't include it
- When in doubt, link to the official documentation rather than making assumptions

**Why this matters**: Incorrect information in a cheat sheet is worse than no cheat sheet at all. Users rely on these quick references in their workflow, and inaccuracies cause frustration and wasted time.

### 3. Guide Users to Official Sources

This cheat sheet is a starting point, not a replacement for official documentation:

- Include prominent links to official documentation throughout
- Add "See official docs" notes for complex features
- Direct users to the source for latest updates and detailed explanations
- Make it easy for users to dive deeper when they need more information

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

- Commands that users need frequently in their daily workflow
- Quick reference tables for common operations
- Practical examples that demonstrate real use cases
- Configuration patterns that solve common problems

### What to Avoid

- Long explanatory prose (keep it concise)
- Redundant information (link to official docs instead)
- Speculative or experimental features without clear documentation
- Overly complex examples that obscure the core concept
- Excessive emojis or visual clutter (prefer clear section headers)

## Documentation Style

### Format Preferences

- Use collapsible sections (`<details>` tags) to keep the guide scannable
- Minimize emojis - use them sparingly for visual structure, not decoration
- Prefer clear, descriptive headers over clever/cute titles
- Use code blocks generously with clear comments
- Keep sections focused and single-purpose

### Structure

- Progressive difficulty levels (Beginner → Expert)
- Command reference tables for quick lookup
- Practical use case examples
- Links to official documentation for deeper learning

## Contributing

When adding new content to this cheat sheet:

1. **Verify accuracy** - Check the official Codex documentation first
2. **Test commands** - Ensure examples actually work as described
3. **Keep it concise** - If it takes more than a few sentences, link to official docs
4. **Follow structure** - Match the existing organization and style
5. **Cite sources** - Reference official documentation or other authoritative sources

## Maintenance

- Review and update when new Codex versions are released
- Remove deprecated commands and add new ones
- Update links when official documentation structure changes
- Respond to issues and PRs that improve accuracy or clarity
